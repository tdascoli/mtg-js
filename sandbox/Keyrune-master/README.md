# Keyrune v1.7.1

## The Magic: the Gathering set symbol font!

Keyrune is the first suite of complete Magic: the Gathering expansion and set symbols as a pictographic font. You can use this font anywhere you want to display set symbols&mdash;in your MtG app or website, documents, card images, anything!

## Usage

Each set symbol has its own font character. Display them in a manner similar to [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) using the `<i class="ss ss-exp"></i>` element. Class name codes are based on the expansion codes from [MTG JSON](http://mtgjson.com).

To use Keyrune, move the font files to your `/fonts` directory and include the keyrune.css stylesheet in your `<head>`:

```html
<link href="css/keyrune.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
```

## Editing the Source

Feel free to edit the source files and compile Keyrune to fit your needs. Currently LESS is supported, with Sass coming soon.

## Using Keyrune on the Desktop

To copy Keyrune symbols into your desktop software (or access to vectors directly), go to the [Cheatsheet](http://andrewgioia.github.io/Keyrune/cheatsheet.html) on the documentation site, copy the character (not the unicode representation), and then paste it into your desktop application after installing keyrune.otf.
